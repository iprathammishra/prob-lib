Problem Statement:

Design a Python program using the concept of classes to manage a library system. The system should be able to handle the following tasks:

Add Book: This will be used to add a new book to the library. A book can have details like book_id, book_name, author, and quantity.

Display Books: This will show all the books available in the library.

Borrow Book: This will allow users to borrow a book from the library. Users should provide their user_id and the book_id they wish to borrow. If the book is available in the library, the system should allocate the book to the user and decrease the quantity of that book.

Book Info: This will show the details of a book.

Remember, you need to use classes and objects to solve this problem. For example, you can create a class named Library that has methods like add_book, display_books, return_book, and book_info. You can also create a class named Book to hold details related to a book.
